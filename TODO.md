# Dredger ToDo's:

## Fixes

- Symlink error in generation process

## Features
- Auto-genrate frontend: When pages exist in spec, set AddFrontend to true
- Convert .templ files to go files after generation
- Init git repo (and create initial commit)
- Post-generation suggestions: "We are done, you can cd ... and start the service just run ..."
- Generate usecase handler functions in usecases/ to fully "hide" application logic (like dredger-rs)
